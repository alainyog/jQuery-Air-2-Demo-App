Level 2

.ajax

1. Get data --  call.. show what we did in Level 1.  returns HTML.

Teaching: .ajaxCallbacks success, cache: false

See http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/5-ways-to-make-ajax-calls-with-jquery/

2. Server returns an error.  A problem will happen, and we'll need to debug, and then add the code so it will show  "Unable to load flights, click here to try again"

Teaching: failure callback, and debug on chrome.

3. Refactoring.. to introduce a "loading" div

Teaching: before and complete callbacks

before ajax callback to hide current flights, and show loading div
complete callback to hide loading div and show current flights

4. Selecting a flight, sending that flight data over, and show total box with jQuery Air Login/Pass. 

Teaching: How to send complex data using JSON, and receiving back JSON to populate hidden div. Cover the "dataType" parameter.  Type of data we're expecting back from server.  

Also show same query using $.getJSON
call would return { 'price': 144.00, 'tax': 24.00 }, internally we'd call showTotal({})

5. Change call to use JSONP..  send with it, a callback method.

Teaching: JSON P
showTotal({});

Also show with $.getScript

6. Do a POST request for Login/Pass.  If valid, show Book Flight and Choose Seats Button.
Detect the proper status code.  OKAY for success, Unauthorized for failure.

Teaches: Types, read status codes

Also, show refactor into using the jQuery.post method.

7. Define a timeout for the ajax call.

Teaches: Timeout

Level 3

Chaining, Timing, Intervals, Effect Queues, Starting/Stoping animation, custom easing methods

1. Make tooltip fadeIn when hover event happens, then Fadeout on MouseLeave

Second step ... add configuration to make it faster.

2. Make tooltip fadeIn and then move down.  animate(margin-top)

Also speed this up to make it faster.

3. Try a different easing with the tooltip FadeIn.

4. Make the Tooltip do both at the same time with queue:false

5. Now that the tooltip is fast, lets add a very slight delay, so the user has to hover for a second over the tab before it appears.

6. After the total box Fade's In, queue up an event to highlight the login box.

7. Use the stop function to stop the tooltip animation on the mouseleave.
