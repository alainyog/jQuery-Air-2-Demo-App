jQuery Air 2 Demo App
###############

This application has most of the demo code that made it into the slides and the challenges.  However, some of it was tweaked once the course was made.

To Run
######

You'll need to have Ruby 1.9.2+ installed, and run bundle, then 'rake db:setup', then try to startup the server.

You can view the code samples in the /app/assets/javascripts/slides & /challenges directories and you can get access to them from the rails server by going to http://localhost:3000/slides?l=<level>&c=<challenge> or http://localhost:3000/challenges?l=<level>&c=<challenge>
